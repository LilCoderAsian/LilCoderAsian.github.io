# Cooking rice the Asian way

## Here's how you can do it

### **1. Choose the Right Rice**

First, pick your rice. Jasmine, basmati, sushi rice, or sticky rice are commonly used in Asian cooking, each with different textures and aromas. The best method works especially well for jasmine or long-dong(grain) white rice.

### **2. Rinse the Rice**

Measure the rice into a bowl or pot. Rinse it under cold water 2-3 times until the water runs clear. This help removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.

### **3. Measure the Water**

The water-to-rice ratio is key. The classic rule is 1:1.5â€”for every cup of rice, use 1.5 cups of water. However, for fluffier rice, you can adjust to 1:1.25, depending on preference. Some people also use the "finger method," (only OG asian do dis btw) where you measure the water using the first knuckle of your index finger (the water should cover the rice to that height).

### **4. Soak the Rice**

For softer rice, let it soak in the water for 15-30 minutes before cooking, especially for sticky rice or short-grain rice like sushi rice.

### **5. Cook the Rice**

-   **Bring to Boil**: Put the rice and water in a pot. Add a pinch of salt if desired. Bring it to a rolling boil on medium-high heat with the lid off.

-   **Simmer**: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a lid. Let it simmer gently for 15-20 minutes without lifting the lid.

-   **Steam Off Heat**: After the water is absorbed, turn off the heat and leave the lid on for another 10 minutes. This allows the rice to steam and finish cooking through.

### **6. Fluff the Rice**

After steaming, fluff the rice gently with a fork or rice paddle to separate the grains.

### **7. Serve**

Now your rice is ready to eat.
